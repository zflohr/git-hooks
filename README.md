# Git Hooks

These are Bash scripts that are executed during the invocation of Git hooks.
The names of the top-level directories in this repository indicate whence the
scripts originate (i.e., all files in [personal-use](personal-use/) originate
from this repository and are used by Git hooks of other repositories on my local
machine to automate workflows for repositories whose remotes belong to my
personal GitHub account.

## Contributing

This is not an open source project. I've made the repository public mainly to
evidence my skills in Git, Bash, GNU utilities, and workflow automation.
